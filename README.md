# This is the source for wut?

## TODO
- check if username already exists
- design home page ( add a little bit more details and I think we are good.)
- look into hashing passwords and personal info in database
- Redo navigation bar (as of right now it looks pretty good).
- implement remember me
- organize folders and make public folder and private folder

## Thoughts on the what the Wu? website should be focused on and how it should work

- Core subjects such as math, english, social studies, and science.
- Categories should be picked when asking.
- Subjects could be divided up into other sub topics.
